 <h2>Viewing HTML source of a webpage in Google Chrome</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Open Google Chrome.</li>
      <li>Navigate to the webpage you wish to look at.</li>
      <li>Right click on the element you wish to examine.</li>
      <li>Select "inspect." A window will appear at the right of the screen <br>
        containing the HTML source for the webpage, with the code of the element <br>
        you selected highlighted.
      <li>This action shall henceforth be known as "peeking behind the tapestry," <br>
        because it allows us to take what we see (the tapestry's exterior design/website) <br>
        and pick a specific part of the fabric (element of the page) and look <br>
        at the back of it to see how it was stitched together.<br>
